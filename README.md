# Analytics-on-Bikeshare-data
  This project demostrates my SQL and Excel skills, and the analysis and visualizations are shown here. The datasets were too big to analyse in Excel alone and so I used SQL to do much of the heavy lifting.

# Background

I looked at bike sharing organizations. (For a background on bicycle sharing systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle-sharing_system ).  There are six bike sharing organisations (in different countries) that I collected the data for.

●	Baywheels (San Francisco Bay area)

●	Blue bikes (Boston)

●	Capital Bike share (Washington DC, Arlington and Alexandria)

●	Citibike (New York)

●	Divvy Bikes (Chicago)

●	Santander (London)


# Upon exploratory analysis of these datasets, I decided to perform analytics Bluebikes and Divvybikes data.

I have compared the data of these two organizations for insights where possible.

Included here are: 

  ● A process reproducibility document (Word document) shows the SQL queries I ran, what I did with them and (if it makes sense) some sample rows of output. 
  
  ● Data dictionary and data handling procedures are indicated in the spreadsheet itself. 
  
  ●	A video of me presenting the key points from this analysis is included here.
